This strategy involves fading extremes when RSI is neutral, and the price is near resistance levels. | - Entry Logic: Enter a SELL position at the current price of $3,331.62, anticipating a reversion to the lower support level. | - Risk Management: The stop-loss is set above the resistance level at $3,345.00 to allow for some price fluctuation, while the take-profit is set at the support level of $3,310.00, providing a favorable risk-reward ratio of 1.5:1."
