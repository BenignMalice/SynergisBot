## 🎯 **Analysis**

### **For SELL Trade:**
- **Entry:** 87,870.71
- **Current SL:** 88,068.12
- **SL Position:** 0.225% above entry

**This is CORRECT for SELL:**
- SL is above entry (protects against price going up)
- Trailing stop moved SL up from breakeven (87,958.58) to current (88,068.12)
- This locks in profit as price moves down

### **Why SL is Above Entry:**
1. **Breakeven was triggered** at 87,958.58 (near entry)
2. **Trailing stop activated** and moved SL up
3. **Current SL (88,068.12)** is above entry, protecting profit
4. **This is normal behavior** - trailing stops move SL to lock in profit
