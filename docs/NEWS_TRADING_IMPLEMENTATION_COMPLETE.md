## 🧠 **GPT-4 Analysis Example:**

**Input:** Non-Farm Payrolls (Actual: 285K, Expected: 175K, Surprise: 62.9%)

**Output:**
- **Sentiment:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 2/10
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Implication:** "The Non-Farm Payrolls significantly exceeded expectations, indicating a strong labor market in the US. This positive surprise is likely to boost the USD as it suggests a healthier economy, potentially leading to increased interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Forex traders should expect a stronger USD in the short term."
