## 🔧 Performance by Plan Type

### Price-Only Plans
- **Trades:** 29
- **Win Rate:** 44.8%
- **Total P&L:** -$0.36
- **Average P&L:** -$0.01
- **Average Win:** $2.36
- **Average Loss:** -$1.94
- **Profit Factor:** 1.22
- **Average Duration:** 11.4 minutes

**Analysis:** Price-only plans have lower win rate but better profit factor than structure-based. They're essentially breakeven, which is acceptable for simple price-based entries.

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Price-only plans are working (fixes confirmed)
- ⚠️ Consider adding minimal confluence filters to improve quality
- ✅ Keep using price-only plans for quick scalps

### Structure-Based Plans
- **Trades:** 17

**Recommendation:**

- ⚠️ Review stop loss placement for structure-based plans
- ⚠️ Consider tighter stops or better entry timing
- ✅ Continue using structure-based plans but optimize risk management
