# BTCUSD_ANALYSIS_QUICK_REFERENCE_EMBEDDING

# PURPOSE
Define deterministic BTC-specific analysis rules aligned with:
- Professional Reasoning Layer (PRL)
- Auto-Execution Validation Layer
- Structure + Volatility Model
- Liquidity + Sweep Model
- Session Behaviour
- Symbol-Specific Derivative Enrichments

All logic MUST follow PRL before BTC analysis begins.

  - includes: Delta Volume, CVD, CVD Slope, CVD Divergence, Absorption Zones, Buy/Sell Pressure, Order Book Imbalance, Whale Activity, Liquidity Voids

## MANDATORY FIELD CHECKLIST (EXPLICIT ENUMERATION)

Before generating BTCUSD output, the model MUST verify ALL of these fields are addressed:

**Order Flow Fields (All Required):**
- [ ] delta_volume (buy_volume, sell_volume, net_delta, dominant_side)
- [ ] cvd.current (raw CVD value)
- [ ] cvd.slope (momentum direction)
- [ ] cvd_divergence.strength (even if 0)
- [ ] cvd_divergence.type (even if null)
- [ ] absorption_zones (ALWAYS - even if empty array, must display "None detected")
- [ ] buy_sell_pressure.ratio
- [ ] buy_sell_pressure.dominant_side
- [ ] order_book_imbalance (if available)
- [ ] whale_activity (if available)
- [ ] liquidity_voids (if available)

**If any field is missing from this checklist, the model MUST state:**
"⚠️ FIELD MISSING: [field_name] not addressed in analysis. Regenerating with complete field enumeration."

## MANDATORY INTERPRETATION RULES (NEVER SKIP)

The model MUST evaluate and interpret ALL of the following for EVERY BTCUSD analysis:

### 1. Delta Volume
- Display: Delta Volume with sign and magnitude (e.g., "+31.7" or "-1.41")
- Interpretation: State whether buy or sell pressure is dominant
- Connection: Must influence final recommendation

### 2. CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta)
- Display: CVD raw value (e.g., "+32.22" or "+0.75")
- Interpretation: State trend direction (rising/falling/recovering)
- Connection: Must influence momentum assessment

### 3. CVD Slope (CRITICAL - NEVER OMIT)
- Display: CVD Slope with sign and units (e.g., "-0.14/bar" or "-0.17/bar")
- Interpretation: 
  - If negative: "CVD slope is negative, indicating weakening internal momentum"
  - If positive: "CVD slope is positive, indicating strengthening momentum"
  - If negative while Delta is positive: "Buy pressure is weakening internally – negative CVD slope contradicts positive Delta. This signals potential exhaustion."
- Connection: MUST override HTF bias when conflicting

### 4. CVD Divergence (ALWAYS CHECK, EVEN IF STRENGTH = 0)
- Display: CVD Divergence strength and type (e.g., "strength: 0, type: null" or "strength: 0.5, type: bearish")
- Interpretation:
  - If strength = 0: "No CVD divergence detected"
  - If strength > 0: "CVD divergence detected: strength <value>, type <type>. This may signal exhaustion or reversal."
- Connection: Must influence entry timing and recommendation

### 5. Absorption Zones (ALWAYS DISPLAY, EVEN IF NONE)
- Display: Absorption zones with price levels and side, OR "None detected" if empty array
- Format: "Absorption Zones: None detected" or "Absorption: Buy-side at $89,200"
- Interpretation:
  - If none: "No absorption zones detected - standard liquidity structure"
  - If present: "Absorption detected at <price>: <side> absorbing pressure, influencing local liquidity structure"
  - If near entry: "Absorption zone near entry price - consider adjusting entry or adding tolerance"
- Connection: Must factor into entry price and final recommendation
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Must display even if `absorption_zones` is empty array - state "None detected"

### 6. Buy/Sell Pressure Ratio
- Display: Ratio with dominant side (e.g., "3.85 : 1 (Buy-side)" or "0.41× (Sell-side)")
- Interpretation: State which side dominates and magnitude
- Connection: Must influence trade direction bias

### 7. Order Book Imbalance
- Display: Percentage with sign (e.g., "+4433%" or "-20%")
- Interpretation:
  - If > ±20%: "Order book imbalance is significant (<value>) and MUST affect trade bias"
  - If < ±20%: "Order book imbalance is minor (<value>)"
- Connection: Must influence liquidity assessment

### 8. Whale Activity
- Display: Net buyer/seller count (e.g., "6 buy vs 1 sell" or "2 sell vs 5 buy")
- Interpretation: State whale bias (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- Connection: Must influence final recommendation

### 9. Liquidity Voids
- Display: Number of zones and description (e.g., "6 zones detected" or "8 zones detected")
- Interpretation: State impact on price movement (whipsaw risk, sharp moves)
- Connection: Must influence risk assessment

## CRITICAL INTERPRETATION LOGIC

### Rule: CVD Slope Contradiction Detection

If CVD slope is negative while Delta Volume is positive, the model MUST state:

"⚠️ CONTRADICTION: Buy pressure is weakening internally – negative CVD slope (-<value>/bar) contradicts positive Delta (+<value>). This signals potential exhaustion or reversal. Recommendation must account for this weakening momentum."

### Rule: CVD Divergence Interpretation (Even if Strength = 0)

The model MUST check CVD divergence even if strength = 0.

- If strength = 0: "No CVD divergence detected (strength: 0)"
- If strength > 0: "CVD divergence detected: strength <value>, type <type>. This may signal exhaustion or reversal and MUST influence entry timing."

### Rule: Absorption Zone Impact (ALWAYS DISPLAY)

The model MUST always display absorption zones status:

1. **If absorption_zones array is empty**: Display "Absorption Zones: None detected"
2. **If absorption zones exist**: Display price level and side (e.g., "Absorption: Buy-side at $89,200")
3. **If near key levels** (entry, SL, TP): Adjust entry price or add tolerance if needed
4. **Always factor into final recommendation**: State impact on liquidity structure

### Rule: Order Flow Overrides HTF Bias

For BTCUSD, strong order-flow signals (CVD slope, absorption, imbalances) MUST override high-timeframe bias when conflicting.

**If structure is unclear and order flow conflicts with trend, recommendation = WAIT.**

The model must not produce a final BUY/SELL/WAIT verdict without referencing order flow conditions directly.

## FINAL VERDICT REQUIREMENT

The final BTCUSD trade verdict MUST reference order flow conditions directly.

**Example format:**
"Verdict: WAIT - Order flow shows weakening buy pressure (negative CVD slope) despite positive Delta, indicating potential exhaustion. Structure unclear. Awaiting confirmation."

**Forbidden format:**
"Verdict: WAIT - No clear structure." (Missing order flow reference)

# BTC_ORDER_FLOW_DISPLAY_REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED - MANDATORY)

btc_order_flow_display:
  - MUST display order flow metrics explicitly in analysis output for BTCUSD
  - Required section: "📊 Order Flow & Liquidity" (or equivalent heading)
  - Format: Use the mandatory checklist format (see UPDATED_GPT_INSTRUCTIONS_EMBEDDING.md)
  
## MANDATORY DISPLAY FIELDS (ALL REQUIRED)

The model MUST display ALL of the following for EVERY BTCUSD analysis:

1. **Delta Volume**
   - Format: "+<value>" or "-<value>" with magnitude
   - Example: "Delta Volume: +31.7 (BUY pressure dominant)"
   - Interpretation: MUST state which side dominates

2. **CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta)**
   - Format: CVD value with trend direction
   - Example: "CVD: +32.22 (rising)" or "CVD: +0.75 but Slope -0.17/bar → Diverging"
   - Interpretation: MUST state trend direction (rising/falling/recovering)

3. **CVD Slope (CRITICAL - NEVER OMIT)**
   - Format: Slope with sign and units
   - Example: "CVD Slope: -0.14/bar (falling)" or "CVD Slope: -0.17/bar (falling)"
   - Interpretation: MUST interpret as weakening/strengthening momentum
   - If negative while Delta positive: MUST state contradiction

4. **Buy/Sell Pressure Ratio**
   - Format: Ratio with dominant side
   - Example: "Buy/Sell Pressure: 3.85 : 1 (Bullish)" or "Buy/Sell Pressure: 0.41× (SELL)"
   - Interpretation: MUST state which side dominates

5. **Liquidity Clusters**
   - Format: Specific price levels
   - Example: "Liquidity Clusters: Stops below $89,198.09" or "Equal Highs/Lows cluster → liquidity targets above and below"
   - Interpretation: MUST state impact on price movement

6. **CVD Divergence (ALWAYS DISPLAY, EVEN IF NONE)**
   - Format: Strength and type, or "None detected"
   - Example: "CVD Divergence: None detected (strength: 0)" or "CVD Divergence: strength 0.5, type bearish"
   - Interpretation: MUST state whether divergence exists and its implications

7. **Absorption Zones (ALWAYS DISPLAY, EVEN IF NONE)**
   - Format: Price level and side, OR "None detected" if empty array
   - Example: "Absorption Zones: None detected" or "Absorption: Buy-side at $89,200"
   - Interpretation: MUST state impact on liquidity structure (or state "No absorption zones detected" if none)
   - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Must display even if `absorption_zones` is empty array - state "None detected"

8. **Order Book Imbalance (IF AVAILABLE)**
   - Format: Percentage with sign
   - Example: "Order Book Imbalance: +4433% (upside liquidity voids forming)"
   - Interpretation: MUST state significance and impact

9. **Whale Activity (IF AVAILABLE)**
   - Format: Net buyer/seller count
   - Example: "Whale Activity: 6 buy vs 1 sell → bullish bias"
   - Interpretation: MUST state whale bias

10. **Liquidity Voids (IF AVAILABLE)**
    - Format: Number of zones
    - Example: "Liquidity Voids: 6 zones detected — price may whipsaw"
    - Interpretation: MUST state impact on price movement

## FORBIDDEN DISPLAY PATTERNS (EXPANDED)

The model MUST NOT produce outputs like:

**❌ Generic Statements (FORBIDDEN):**
- "Order flow is mixed" (too generic - must specify each metric)
- "Order flow shows bullish bias" (missing specific values)
- "CVD data unavailable" (when CVD exists in snapshot)
- "Order flow metrics inconclusive" (must interpret each field)

**❌ Incomplete Field Display (FORBIDDEN):**
- Display only Delta Volume without CVD Slope
- Display CVD without CVD Slope
- Display Buy/Sell Pressure without Delta Volume
- Omit CVD Divergence even if strength = 0
- Display "CVD: positive" without showing slope

**❌ Collapsed Fields (FORBIDDEN):**
- "Order flow: Bullish" (must break down: Delta, CVD, Slope, etc.)
- "Multiple order flow signals" (must list each signal)
- "Order flow confirms structure" (must show which metrics confirm)

**❌ Missing Interpretation (FORBIDDEN):**
- Displaying values without interpretation
- Displaying "CVD Slope: -0.14/bar" without explaining what it means
- Displaying "CVD Divergence: strength 0" without stating "No divergence detected"

**✅ Required Format (CORRECT):**
- "Delta Volume: +31.7 (BUY pressure dominant). CVD: +32.22 (rising). CVD Slope: -0.14/bar (weakening momentum - contradicts positive Delta). CVD Divergence: None detected (strength: 0). Buy/Sell Pressure: 3.85:1 (Bullish but thin liquidity)."

## MISSING FIELD HANDLING

If a field is not available in the data:
- The model MUST state: "Field X not available in this snapshot"
- The model MUST NOT silently omit it
- The model MUST explain why it cannot be interpreted

# MACRO_CONTEXT_TOOL
btc_macro_tool:

# PROFESSIONAL_REASONING_LAYER_DEPENDENCY
BTC analysis must follow PRL stages:
  1. price_fetch_required
  2. regime_classification
  3. strategy_selection
  4. volatility_structure_conflict_check

# ADVANCED VOLATILITY STATES (Phase 1.4)

**Reference**: AUTO_EXECUTION_CHATGPT_KNOWLEDGE_EMBEDDED.md for detection criteria.

## PRE_BREAKOUT_TENSION (BTCUSD Behavior)

**BTCUSD Characteristics:**
- BTC often compresses before major moves (especially London/NY opens)
- BB width narrows to <1.5% (bottom 20th percentile)
- Wick variance increases ≥30% (institutional accumulation/distribution)
- Intra-bar volatility rising ≥20% (pressure building)

**Valid Strategies:**
- `breakout_ib_volatility_trap` (prioritize - compression before breakout)
- `liquidity_sweep_reversal` (prioritize - sweep likely after compression)
- `breaker_block` (prioritize - failed OB retest after compression)

**Avoid:**
- `mean_reversion_range_scalp` (compression suggests breakout, not range)
- `trend_continuation_pullback` (compression suggests new move, not pullback)

**BTCUSD-Specific Notes:**
- BTC compression often resolves during London/NY opens
- Compression periods often see increased order block quality
- Watch for CVD divergence during compression (can signal direction)
- Compression often precedes major liquidation events

## POST_BREAKOUT_DECAY (BTCUSD Behavior)

**BTCUSD Characteristics:**
- BTC breakouts often fade quickly (5-30 minutes after breakout)
- ATR declining ≥5% per period (momentum fading)
- ATR still above baseline (>1.2x) but declining
- Common after London/NY session opens

**Valid Strategies:**
- `mean_reversion_range_scalp` (prioritize - momentum fading, mean reversion works)
- `fvg_retracement` (prioritize - FVG fills after breakout)
- `order_block_rejection` (prioritize - OB rejection after breakout)

**Avoid:**
- `trend_continuation_pullback` (momentum fading - continuation unlikely)
- `breakout_ib_volatility_trap` (breakout already occurred)
- `market_structure_shift` (momentum fading - structure shift unlikely)

**BTCUSD-Specific Notes:**
- BTC often retraces 50-61.8% after breakouts before continuing
- Post-breakout decay more common in Asian/Late NY sessions
- Watch for CVD reversal during decay (can accelerate retracement)
- Post-breakout decay often coincides with funding rate normalization

## FRAGMENTED_CHOP (BTCUSD Behavior)

**BTCUSD Characteristics:**
- BTC can show choppy behavior during low-liquidity periods
- Whipsaw detected (≥3 direction changes in 5 candles)
- Mean reversion pattern (price oscillating within 0.5 ATR of VWAP)
- Low ADX (<15) indicating low momentum

**Valid Strategies:**
- `micro_scalp` (prioritize - only valid strategy in chop)
- `mean_reversion_range_scalp` (prioritize - mean reversion works in chop)

**Avoid:**
- `trend_continuation_pullback` (no clear trend)
- `breakout_ib_volatility_trap` (choppy conditions - no clean breakout)
- `liquidity_sweep_reversal` (choppy conditions - sweeps unreliable)
- `market_structure_shift` (no clear structure)
- `fvg_retracement` (choppy conditions - FVG unreliable)

**BTCUSD-Specific Notes:**
- BTC chop more common during Asian session or low-volume periods
- Chop often precedes major moves (watch for PRE_BREAKOUT_TENSION transition)
- VWAP becomes strong magnet during chop
- Chop often coincides with low CVD slope (weak momentum)

## SESSION_SWITCH_FLARE (BTCUSD Behavior)

**BTCUSD Characteristics:**
- BTC often spikes during London/NY session transitions
- Volatility spike (ATR >1.5x baseline) during session change
- Flare resolving (ATR declining ≥10% from spike within 30 minutes)
- Common at 08:00 UTC (London open) and 13:00 UTC (NY open)

**Valid Strategies:**
- [] (empty - WAIT required)

**Avoid:**
- ALL (blocks all strategies during flare)

**BTCUSD-Specific Notes:**
- BTC flare more common during London/NY opens
- Flare often resolves within 15-30 minutes
- Wait for stabilization before creating plans
- Flare can trigger false breakouts - wait for confirmation
- Flare often coincides with large liquidation events

**Accessing Volatility Metrics:**
- Check `response.data.volatility_metrics.regime` from `moneybot.analyse_symbol_full`
- Check `response.data.volatility_metrics.strategy_recommendations` for prioritize/avoid lists
- Check `response.data.strategy_selection` (top-level convenience field) OR `response.data.volatility_regime.strategy_selection` (nested) for selected strategy and all scores
- If `wait_reason` present → DO NOT create plan
- Check `response.data.volatility_metrics.atr_trend` for M15 ATR trend
- Check `response.data.volatility_metrics.wick_variance` for M15 wick variance
- Check `response.data.volatility_metrics.time_since_breakout_minutes` for breakout timing
