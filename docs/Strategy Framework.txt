⚙️ 1️⃣ Core Continuation Frameworks (Trend Phase)

✅ For London/NY sessions — most volume, clean structure.

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
BOS Continuation (Buy/Sell)	{"choch_bull": true} or {"choch_bear": true} with M1 confirmation	London/NY overlap	Captures post-BOS trend extension
Momentum Continuation	Volatility expanding + EMA slope alignment	Overlap	Ride institutional momentum flow
VWAP Anchored Continuation	VWAP support/resistance holds	NY	Confirms trend sustainability
Pullback Re-entry	Price retests previous BOS/OB level	London	Re-entry after impulse exhaustion
Continuation Buy/Sell	{"bos_bull": true} / {"bos_bear": true} + confluence ≥ 80	London/Overlap	Trend follow-through execution
⚡ 2️⃣ Breakout & Expansion Strategies

✅ For high-volatility sessions (London open or NY overlap).

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
Breakout Buy/Sell	{"price_above": entry} / {"price_below": entry}	London	Captures expansion beyond liquidity zone
CHOCH Breakout (Buy/Sell)	{"choch_bull": true} / {"choch_bear": true}	London	Confirms new directional phase
Volatility Expansion Breakout	ATR rising + BB width expanding	Overlap	Captures initial volatility release
Bracket Trade (Buy+Sell)	Dual pending orders above/below range	London	One cancels other — safe breakout execution
Asian Range Breakout	{"price_above": asian_high} / {"price_below": asian_low}	07:00–09:00 UTC	Classic London Breakout structure
💎 3️⃣ Reversal & Liquidity Sweep Strategies

✅ For late London / NY sessions — liquidity traps and reversals.

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
Sweep Buy/Sell	{"liquidity_sweep": true} + {"rejection_wick": true}	London/NY	Fade liquidity grabs near PDH/PDL
Rejection Wick (Buy/Sell)	{"rejection_wick": true}	NY	Confirm exhaustion candle reversal
PDH/PDL Sweep	Liquidity grab beyond previous day high/low	London/NY	Stop-hunt reversal confirmation
Liquidity Grab + OB Retest	Sweep → OB validation	London	Smart money reversal entry
VWAP Deviation Buy/Sell	±2σ deviation + reversal wick	NY	Mean reversion from VWAP extremes
🧭 4️⃣ Order Block & Institutional Re-Entry Strategies

✅ Smart Money Concept-based setups for institutional re-entry.

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
OB Retest Buy/Sell	{"order_block": true, "order_block_type": "auto"}	London	Institutional retrace entry
Order Block + FVG Combo	OB + imbalance fill (FVG)	Overlap	Precision institutional re-entry
Trend Pullback Buy/Sell	{"choch_bull": true} + EMA trend alignment	London/NY	Trend continuation after pullback
Mitigation Block Trade	Retest of opposing OB after displacement	London	Institutional continuation filter
Anchor Candle OB	OB confirmed with displacement + volume spike	Overlap	Institutional footprint confirmation
🪙 5️⃣ Range & Mean Reversion Strategies

✅ For low-volatility periods — ideal during Asian session.

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
Range Scalp Buy/Sell	{"price_near": range_edge, "liquidity_zone": true}	Asian	Fade range extremes (2–3R setups)
VWAP Reversion (Buy/Sell)	VWAP midline reversion	Asian/NY	Mean reversion from stretched VWAP
Accumulation Range Buy/Sell	Equal highs/lows forming liquidity pool	Pre-London	Early accumulation before expansion
OB Accumulation Reversal	{"order_block": true} + structure shift	Asian	Institutional entry before breakout
Low-Volatility Bounce	{"volatility_state": "contracting"} + rejection wick	Asian	Anticipates range compression reversal
🔥 6️⃣ Hybrid Institutional Setups

✅ High-confluence, multi-condition setups validated by M1 microstructure.

Strategy	Trigger Condition	Ideal Session	Purpose
Liquidity Sweep + OB Retest	{"liquidity_sweep": true, "order_block": true}	London/Overlap	Smart money fakeout + continuation
VWAP + BOS Confluence	Price reclaims VWAP + BOS confirmation	NY	Combines structure and flow
Smart Momentum Scalper	Momentum + OB + VWAP alignment	Overlap	Institutional-quality short-term scalp
CHOCH + OB Combo	Structure shift + institutional block	London	Early trend reversals with precision
Session Flow Hybrid	Session-aware adaptive logic (OB + VWAP)
